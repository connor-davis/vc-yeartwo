## Requirements Gathering
Collecting information about the data that the database is expected to store and the various operations that will be performed on that data.

## Conceptual Schema Design
Creating a high level representation of the database schema, including entities, attributes and relationships

## Data modelling
Choosing the appropriate data model for the database, such as the relational model, hierarchical model or object orientated model

## Normalization
Ensuring that the database schema is normalized to eliminate redundancy

## Common methods of information collection
Surveys:

Interviews:

## The purpose and benefits of the database logical design phase
**Improved data accuracy:**
The logical design phase ensures that the database schema is optimised for accuracy, consistency and completeness, which reduces the risks of data inconsitencies.

**Improved data security:**


**Improved data performance:**
